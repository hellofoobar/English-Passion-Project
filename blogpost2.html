  		<h4>Blog Post #2 <br> The Emotions Behind Escape</h4>
  		<p class="paragraph">
  			Emotions are the driving force of what it means to be human. Specifically, an old saying states that one must separate your ‘wants’ and ‘needs’ when sorting out one’s life. Emotions are an integral part of any decision-making process, and their power cannot be denied in any situation, complicated or otherwise. A particularly extreme example of this is a blog post by Carin Meyer, a woman who is bipolar. She helps to show the underlying reason for many attempted escapes from reality: to discover what one really wants out of life.
  		</p> 
  		<p class="paragraph">
  			For Carin Meyer, her hypomania resulted in her wanting to escape reality by trying “… to find a way to run away into the wilderness” (Meyer). Throughout her blog post, she frequently elucidates on her desire to escape her boring version of reality—her government job—and explore the world. She wanted to live in the wild, eating what she hunts, as well as gathering edible plants. In such a situation, it is evident that she wants to escape her reality by discovering her own reality by living on her own and surviving on her own merits. While she never followed through with these plans, but the desire was still there. Her innate desire to escape was responsible for upending her life on numerous occasions, and it is something that we see very frequently in fiction as well.

  			In The Sniper by Liam O’Flaherty, a sniper is locked in a deadly confrontation with another sniper in the Irish Civil War. To me, though, the most important portion of the short story is the main character’s reaction to winning the deadly duel:
  		</p>
  		<p class="paragraph">
  			This is a logical emotional response to killing a man, and it is also a logical response that the main character wanted to escape the reality of his current situation. He is going through the reasons from not only himself, but the war and everything else that led him to pulling the trigger of his revolver. Readers can only guess what his reaction was to the twist ending of the story, when he rolls over the body to reveal that he had been fighting—and that he had killed—his brother. What would his reaction be then? Would he physically try to flee the scene? Would he just roll the body back over and mentally bury the fact that he had killed his brother? Would he do both? The story ends at the reveal, so we don’t know, but all three scenarios are plausible.
  		</p>
  		<p class="paragraph">
  			Ultimately, what matters with the desire to escape one’s reality is how we deal with those emotions. Escaping at every moment that you can is not healthy and doesn’t really provide mental or physical stimulation. This quote helps illustrate what I mean best, that “… it is a rare person who is not trying to escape. Look at the obesity epidemic in children and adults. People eat to feel good. And they find it hard to stop. Again, it’s universal” (Skolnick). People seek escape through many means. Maybe their work life isn’t what it should be. Maybe they just want to relax. It doesn’t have to be a big deal, but it still is a form of escape when someone decides to eat McDonald’s instead of a healthier meal that’s sitting in their fridge.
  		</p>
  		<p class="paragraph">
  			Another common saying is that it is best to live in the moment, and not in the future or in the past. It is how we react to a situation is how we are judged by our contemporaries. If you seek an escape in food, and just continue eating without remorse, then you will be judged for a lack of mental fortitude. However, if you realize that what you are doing is wrong, and that you don’t necessarily need to overindulge, then there a myriad of different options to help you lose that weight. In The Sniper, it is the main character who judges himself for his deeds, and tries to escape his reality by blaming himself and others. In that moment, he wants to be anywhere but in that situation. No one can blame him for this reaction, but they can blame him for shooting and killing his brother. Yes, the main character was at war and he was fighting to save himself, but discovering his dead brother was just the cherry on top in this situation: that no matter what you do, there are always consequences for one’s actions.
