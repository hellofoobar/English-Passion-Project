  		<h4>Blog Post #1 <br> Why Escape?</h4>
  		<p class="paragraph">
  			There are many reasons for wanting to escape reality. Some find it too difficult, some are lazy, while others just want a different change of pace. Situations are rarely as they seem on the surface. While it is easy to categorize an emotion or situation in black and white definitions, that does not make it such. The truth is a multi-faceted and sly creature. When you think you know the truth, it often turns out to be something completely different. This is a constantly repeating theme in fiction, when the author surprises the reader with a twist ending that seemingly appears out of nowhere.
  		</p> 
  		<p class="paragraph">
  			But before we begin discussing twist endings, we must discuss what the word ‘escape’ means. The best definition I found was posted by another student online:
  		</p>
  		<p class="paragraph">
  			“[The] desire to escape is [a] feeling restricted by some kind of force and having a desire to remove this restriction from yourself emotionally. Once you have escaped this force, you will feel… [freer]… than you did before. Escaping can be a literal or metaphorical action…” ("What Is Desire To Escape?").
  		</p>
  		<p class="paragraph">
  			What’s important is that realizing the desire to escape reality can be either an emotional or physical escape. Disengaging from a toxic situation can be just as harrowing as escaping a deadly confrontation. This just highlights that we are all human and unique. What barely affects one individual can have drastic consequences on another. That doesn’t mean that your view of the world is incorrect, but it does mean that you have had different life experiences, just like everyone else. 
  		</p>
  		<p class="paragraph">
  			The purpose of this blog is to discuss different fictional characters escaping (or attempting to) their realities and juxtapose this with a discussion on the emotions (and people’s reasoning) on escape. I hope you will join me on my next blog post: The Emotions Behind Escape.
  		</p>
  		<p class="paragraph">
  			And that discussion that I promised on twist endings? You’ll have to wait until the next blog post. What a twist!
