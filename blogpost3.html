     <h4>Blog Post #3 <br> The Escape Formula</h4>
     <p class="paragraph">
       We have discussed why people want to escape their own reality, and the emotions behind escape, but the act of escape in of itself is quite different. What leads up to the decision to escape or continue with their lives? Fiction, particularly fantasy fiction, is built upon this concept, and it is “our intrinsic need for escape [that] also factor’s directly into fantasy’s popularity…” (Mazour). A common cliché in fantasy is that a farm-boy is told that he is the prophesized hero of the world, and that it is only him that can stop the Dark Lord TM from destroying everything that he loves. Robert Jordan’s The Wheel of Time series starts off in this manner, with the protagonist leaving his farming village to eventually become one of the heroes that saves the world.
     </p> 
     <p class="paragraph">
       Of course, there are variations to this formula. In The Lord of the Rings, it is a hobbit that leaves the Shire in order to save the world from the dark lord Sauron, and in the Chronicles of Narnia, it is the Pevensie children who save the land of Narnia from many dangers, including the White Witch. In all three of these examples, it relates to individuals who have little political and/or physical power, who then later (by the end of the story) have a great deal of power, political or otherwise. To summarize this, “… a great part of the frustration… protagonists feel corresponds directly to the amount of freedom and escape they achieve” (Ellis). They want to matter, or to mean something, and to do that the protagonist’s feel that they must upend their entire lifestyle.
     </p>
     <p class="paragraph">
       It is a common response to feel shackled to parts of (or even your entire) lifestyle. When people say that the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence, that is what they mean. For a lot of people, including fictional heroes, they desire an outlet. Maybe they didn’t know how exactly they would complete their chosen task, but they know their end goal. For many, that is the mental portion of the escape, the planning stage. In On Turning Ten, the main protagonist states that even though they are young, they still have dreams, and they fantasize about different things, such as becoming an Arabian wizard at four-years-old. While the poem ends with the main character dispensing their imaginary friends, the entire poem reflects a sense of nostalgia to the reader, that everyone, young or old, has dreams, and that they use them to escape their version of reality.
