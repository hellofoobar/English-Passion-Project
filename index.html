  				<h2 class="bio">Hello I'm Gudi, welcome to my blog.</h2>
  				<p class="bio">
  					Do you ever wonder about potentially choosing a lifestyle that is completely different from your own? I do, and so do many others. Movies, books, plays have opened up a new dimension for audiences (and authors) to escape to. However, this presents a question: why do people want to escape reality?<br>
  					I researched and wrote three blog posts, each with different topics and ideas on escaping reality. The first post relates on why people want to escape and introduces the topic of how people want (and try) to escape reality both physically and mentally. The second post is about the emotions behind escaping our reality, referring to how when people decide to act, it is primarily our emotions that we consult before the decision is made. The third is about how escaping in of itself is a fictional formula. Escaping reality is a story device that has been used for millennia, and in this final post we discuss how it has been used in famous works of fiction.

  						<h5>Mazour, Abbigail. "The Reality Of Escape In Fantasy". Digital Commons, 2018, https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/<br>cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&context=honorstheses. Accessed 19 Jan 2019.</h5>
  						<p><font color="dimgray">This is a graduate student’s honors thesis, and it is divided into multiple sections that explains how characters escape reality in fantasy works such as Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings. It studies and discusses the effect of escape in fantasy, and how it in return affects the overall plot. This information is relevant because it goes into extreme detail on elaborating on its point: that being able to escape is valuable to its audiences. I expect to use most of this source during this assignment. I also will use it as a building block for my own research argument.

  						<p><font color="dimgray">This is an article that discusses emotions and how they reflect upon the author’s desire to escape. It speaks of the author’s desire to escape and how she dealt with her conflicting emotions. This is important because it offers a different perspective on escape. I found the entire source to be a useful explanation of wanting to escape. I expect to use the entire source when referring on the emotions behind the desire to escape.

  						<p><font color="dimgray">This is an article that tries to help the reader discover the reasons for why they want to escape their reality. It is arranged to gently push the reader in a positive direction. This is relevant because I can use this article to help evaluate characters and the overall meaning behind the word ‘escape’. I expect to use sections of the article in order to make my point. I will use this article as an initial building block whenever I am beginning a discussion about a character.</font></p>

  						<p><font color="dimgray">This is a submitted dissertation on the idea of escape and how certain authors (and their fictional characters) embraced the idea of escape. It covers Kate Chopin, Edith Wharton, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Ernest Hemingway, along with a conclusion and a biographical sketch. This information is important because with this dissertation I will be able to compare popular Western authors and their ideas of escape. I expect the entire source to be useful. I find it likely that each chapter in the dissertation will be used in order to help argue my points on escaping reality.

  						<p><font color="dimgray">This is the home page to a group assignment on different fictional characters and how they react to the desire to escape. It is divided by each student’s contributions. It is important for its definition of the desire to escape, which I will be using. It is the only relevant portion of the page which I will be using. I will use it as a building block to define the urge to escape in a clear and concise manner.</font></p>
